* DONE Process that forks and creates a channel over which we can send file descriptors
* DONE fork+exec instead of just fork?
** DONE Introduce clap
* DONE Three processes
** This maybe looks cleaner with fork+exec?
* DONE Two subprocess communicate, i.e. we have the parent send the two ends of another socket over the already established parent<->child channels
* DONE mio
** I've actually gone wiht tokio initially...maybe for the best if I have more experience with tokio?
* TODO Channel message type can differ between channels

* TODO One process has some sort of parser
* TODO Woops parser using a third-party library that is backdoored unbeknownst to us
* TODO Understand some of the stuff
